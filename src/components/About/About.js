            <p>Hi! I'm Alexa, and I'm a book addict. I currently 
                have 241 books in my possession, and wanted to create
                a site where I can share my current Top Ten Books! There
                is a lot of genre diversity in this list, whether you want
                to cry, laugh, get in your feels, or leap into a magical world, 
                I've got something here for you.
            </p>
